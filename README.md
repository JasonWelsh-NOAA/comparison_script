Description of obsproc-verification-tool

The attached script computes the file size differences and file size percent differences of files within a desginated directory.  
Also, there is a binv command from a linux command line and computes the differences for all the categories of obs types in a specified prepbufr file, 
and produces obs count differences and percent difference.  Within the script, you can specify at the top of the script
the two different directories you want to compare.  Also, make sure when you run the script to first do a "module 
load python/3.8.6 " as it needs this module in order to run properly.
